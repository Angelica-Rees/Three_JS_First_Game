Description:
This project is my first exploration of the Three.js Javascript Library. In it, there is a simple plane and robot with character controls set up (WASD and space for jump when walking). There is no boundary so you can just walk directly off into the void if you want. The camera follows the character but cannot be moved by the user (i.e. no mouse controls). 
Enjoy :) 

How to run the 3js thing locally (as done with npm): 
In terminal: 
  1. `npm init -y`
  2. `npm install vite --save-dev`
  3. `npm install three`
  4. `npx vite`
  5. `ctrl + click` on the localhost that it's running on
